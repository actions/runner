# Actions Connection Check

## What is this check for?

Make sure the runner has access to actions service for GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Server

- For GitHub.com
  - The runner needs to access https://api.github.com for downloading actions.
  - The runner needs to access https://vstoken.actions.githubusercontent.com/_apis/.../ for requesting an access token.
  - The runner needs to access https://pipelines.actions.githubusercontent.com/_apis/.../ for receiving workflow jobs.
- For GitHub Enterprise Server
  - The runner needs to access https://myGHES.com/api/v3 for downloading actions.
  - The runner needs to access https://myGHES.com/_services/vstoken/_apis/.../ for requesting an access token.
  - The runner needs to access https://myGHES.com/_services/pipelines/_apis/.../ for receiving workflow jobs.

## How to fix the issue?

### 1. Check the common network issue
  
  > Please check the [network doc](./network.md)

### 2. SSL certificate related issue

  If you are seeing `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception.` in the log, it means the runner can't connect to Actions service due to SSL handshake failure.
  > Please check the [SSL cert doc](./sslcert.md)
