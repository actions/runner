_Note: Actions Runner follows a progressive release policy, so the latest release might not be available to your enterprise, organization, or repository yet. 
To confirm which version of the Actions Runner you should expect, please view the download instructions for your enterprise, organization, or repository. 
See https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners_

## Windows x64
We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```

## [Pre-release] Windows arm64
**Warning:** Windows arm64 runners are currently in preview status and use [unofficial versions of nodejs](https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/). They are not intended for production workflows.

We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```
