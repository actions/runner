## Windows x64

We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:

```powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ;
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```
