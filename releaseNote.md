## Windows x64
We recommend configuring the runner in a root folder of the Windows drive (e.g. "C:\actions-runner"). This will help avoid issues related to service identity folder permissions and long file path restrictions on Windows.

The following snipped needs to be run on `powershell`:
``` powershell
# Create a folder under the drive root
mkdir \actions-runner ; cd \actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip
# Extract the installer
Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem ; 
[System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::ExtractToDirectory("$PWD\actions-runner-win-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.zip", "$PWD")
```

## OSX

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-osx-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-osx-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux x64

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux arm64 (Pre-release)

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm64-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```

## Linux arm (Pre-release)

``` bash
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner
# Download the latest runner package
curl -O -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v<RUNNER_VERSION>/actions-runner-linux-arm-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-arm-<RUNNER_VERSION>.tar.gz
```
