          **✅ Full Fix Applied Successfully**
          This update addresses npm security advisories and ensures dependencies are secure and up-to-date.
          
          **Changes made:**
          - Applied `npm audit fix --force` to resolve security vulnerabilities
          - Updated package-lock.json with security patches
          - Verified build compatibility with `npm run all`
          
          **Next steps:**
          - Review the dependency changes  
          - Verify the hashFiles functionality still works as expected
          - Merge when ready

          Automated npm audit fix for security vulnerabilities in hashFiles dependencies.
          
          **⚠️ Security Fixes Applied - Build Issues Need Manual Resolution**
          This update applies important security patches but causes build failures that require manual fixes.
          
          **Changes made:**
          - Applied `npm audit fix --force` to resolve security vulnerabilities
          - Updated package-lock.json with security patches
          
          **⚠️ Build Issues Detected:**
          The build fails after applying security fixes, likely due to TypeScript compatibility issues with updated `@types/node`.
          
          **Required Manual Fixes:**
          1. Review TypeScript compilation errors in the build output
          2. Update TypeScript configuration if needed
          3. Consider pinning `@types/node` to a compatible version
          4. Run `npm run all` locally to verify fixes
          
          **Next steps:**
          - **DO NOT merge until build issues are resolved**
          - Apply manual fixes for TypeScript compatibility
          - Test the hashFiles functionality still works as expected
          - Merge when build passes
